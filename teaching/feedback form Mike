* the opening stuff about the course at UCSB is good -- but somewhere you should remind what that course was actually about. The impression given is of a computational course
but is that what it was?

* in general this is all good but in the middle section there is a sense of 'being willing to do as asked' whereas you want to appear to be proactively thinking about how 
teaching should best be done (especially as undergrads get less and less comfortable with a one-hour uninterrupted lecture). You might mention the current 'needs must' move
to online teaching and say to what extent you'd expect that to be permanent. People are looking to hire faculty who can seriously tackle structural issues as well as just 
turn up and give a course on demand.  The last part is excellent and gives a strong sense that you care about students, but doesn't convey a similar concern about the
teaching enterprise and how it needs to evolve to meet their needs.

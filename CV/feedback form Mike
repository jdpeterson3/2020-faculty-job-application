Hi Joe

Comments on CV:

* unusual to give home address -- it makes you look unemployed! So use DAMTP even if the building is closed for COVID-19, or if you want give both addresses with the home one marked '(during Covid)'. But actually you don't need a street address and few people would give one so long as there is a full departmental affiliation
* it's unusual to list 'postdoctoral studies' under 'education'. I would title this section 'Education and Employment' and label it 'Postdoctoral Researcher' which is more like a job title. (I think officially it is 'postdoctoral research associate'.) And you need to name the department (DAMTP need not be spelt out as it is a global brand among Chem Eng folk).
* the research interest 'nonlinear dynamics of biological systems' might possibly be renamed to emphasise the biosystems engineering aspect which comes across in the research plan.

* Postdoctoral scholar... funded by Unilever Corporation -> Postdoctoral researcher... funded by Unilever PLC and European Research Council, then add constitutive modelling of dense granular suspensions as a third topic (otherwise these papers on your list look like you can't have had much involvement).
* At some future point -- once they run onto several pages -- you will probably want to list your publications most-recent first, and give them permanent numbers so the list looks like [20,19,....1] and gets updated by adding 21 at the top. There is no hurry to do this, of course, but already numbers would help so people don't have to count for themselves.

* my inclination would be to keep this list for things that have been fully written, in which case the last one might get shifted to the 'in preparation' list.
* Add arXiv reference for the paper in press at JoR with Gary and Glenn, and create and add one for our first JoR paper. Do the same for the second one, once Unilever approve. This is not just a CV issue -- if you want to reach the physics community, stuff MUST be on arXiv otherwise it will just not be read.

* The Andriano reference is incomplete -- needs page number.

* I think with 'et al' papers you should give the full author list unless it is extremely long.

* for conference talks, the way you do it is OK for now, but at some stage in your career you will probably drop talks that you did not personally present and divide the others into invited and contributed. Later on, only the invited ones will be listed.  Around that point you should also make this a numbered list, most recent first.

* (RECORDED -> (RECORDED)  You need to underline yourself (or the speaker) on these items
*References -> Referees (at least that would be UK usage)

To my view, the core interest of chemical engineering lies in creating a
 world that makes the best possible use of its limited resources.
 When crude oil was fit for nothing more than fuel, chemical engineers distilled
 it and processed it into everything from plastics to pharmaceuticals.
 Over time, chemical engineering has also subsumed special interests in
 soft matter physics and biological engineering with the same over-arching
 goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In soft matter physics, there are unique opportunities to develop low-cost
 and high value-added materials by careful engineering at the microstrucutral
 level.
 However, there are always at least two major technical obstacles to viable
 commercial production (1) the material must be processed into the target
 microsctructure and (2) processing must be sufficiently fast/efficient
 to keep the operation profitable.
 Rheology is the sub-discipline of soft matter physics that attends to these
 challenges, bridging the gap between knowledge of the microstructure and
 understanding of the bulk flow behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my research as a rheologist, I am principally concerned with industrially-rel
evant complex fluids that are already being processed in enormous volumes
 - hundreds of billions of pounds per year â€“ including commodity polymers

\end_inset

.
 Improvements in the way such materials are processed can have enormous
 market impacts by reducing waste, increasing through-put, and/or enhancing
 the value of the final product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Biological engineering is a core discipline in most chemical engineering
 departments today, but the broader study of biological systems extending
 to the level of whole ecosystems has recieved comparatively less attention.
 However, it is my view that the future of chemical engineering must eventually
 include biological systems engineering at this level.
 For example, the raw materials for a renewables revolution are primarily
 going to be sourced from an agricultural system under increasing strain
 from disease 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-15"

\end_inset

, pests 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and pollinator decline 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-17"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, current trends in agricultrual expansion and invasive species
 are stressing the natural ecosystems we rely on for carbon capture, water
 purification, nutrient cycling, and more 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I helped develop new tools for studying disease
 transmission in human populations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In my future research, I would like to repurpose these tools to study ecosystem
s - both natural and agricultural - under stress from disease, invasive
 species, climate change, and more.
 Ultimately, ecosystems can be seen as a special kind of reaction/diffusion
 problem, and as such are well within the core competency of the chemical
 engineer.
 But more importantly, maintaining healthy ecosystems is integral to the
 core interest of chemical engineering as a field: creating a world that
 makes the best possible use of its limited resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these motivations in mind, I outline three prospective research topics
 that interest me.
 First, as a continuation of my PhD and postdoctoral studies, I would like
 to study competing explanations of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

die drool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 phenomena in polymer extrustion.
 Second, there is an opportunity to fill a gap between theory and practice
 for high Reynolds number flows of many complex fluids.
 Third, I propose an example problem for modeling epizootic controls of
 invasive species

 Unified model of die drool

\begin_layout Standard
In industry practice, polymer extrusion is often limited by flow instabilities
 and irregularies that mar the extrudate, including melt fracture and shark-skin
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-22"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, as well as die drool 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-23"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In each case, there are empirical strategies for mitigation, but theoretical
 understanding is still considered incomplete in many respects.
 Over the past few decades, there have been remarkable advances in both
 (1) CFD-friendly and microscopically accurate rheological models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-51,key-53"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and (2) the power of computing resources needed to solve such models.
 From my experience working with companies like 3M and Unilever, I have
 seen that the 'trial and error' stage of die design and product formulation
 is increasingly being shifted towards in-silico experiments.
 With the tools that I've developed during my PhD and postdoctoral studies,
 I believe that there is a unique opportunity to build a unified modelling
 framework to study 'die drool' phenomena in polymer extrusion.

In polymer extrusion, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

die drool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the slow build-up of polymer melt at the die face, as shown in
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, and it mars the extrudate when it drips down or chars onto the die face,
 for example.
 It is clear from the existing literature that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 itself consists of chains that are shorter than those in the main extrudate,
 but it is not yet clear (1) how those short chains became sequestered at
 the outermost layer of the flow or (2) why the outermost layer of the flow
 (comprising mostly short chains) separates from the main extrudate onto
 the die face.
 The proposal that I outline here will focus on the first of these two questions
, but in principal the modelling framework I propose is suitable to consider
 both questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two prevailing hypothesis for how short chains become sequestered
 near the extruder walls: flow induced fractionation and chain degradation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-23"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In one instance, it is hypothesized that gradients in the stress drive
 long chains to migrate away from the wall, where shear rates are highest
 [REFS].
 In the second instance, it is hypothesized that polymer degradation (i.e.
 long chains breaking into short chains) can be significant near the extruder
 walls, due to a combination of high shear rates, high temperatures, and
 long residence times.
 It is difficult to distinguish between these two hypothesis in an experimental
 setting, and each of these mechanisms could be dominant depending on the
 particulars of the melt composition, flow rate, and extruder geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To gain a clearer understanding of die drool phenomena, I want to study
 a multi-fluid approximation of polydisperse blends with flow-induced scission
 in an annular flow.
 This study would combine my PhD work on multi-fluid models of polydisperse
 blends 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 with my postdoctoral studies of breakable polymer rheology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-56,key-57"

\end_inset

.
 The results of this study would yield both (1) experimentally testable
 predictions for the extrudate's annular composition and (2) a broader picture
 for how these two mechanisms contribute (or even interact) to produce die
 drool under various flow conditions.
 This study will bring new insights to the mechanism behind 'die drool'
 formation, and should also provide opportunities to improve existing mitigation
 strategies.

 Reynolds Averaging for Complex Fluids

\begin_layout Standard
In recent decades, rheologists and soft matter physicists have made remarkable
 progress in building constitutive equations that connect the microscopic
 structure of a material to its bulk flow behavior.
 At one point, microscopically-derived constitutive models were only available
 for very simple non-Newtonian fluids, such as dilute suspensions of hard
 spheres, droplets, and polymers.
 Today, however, microscopically-derived constitutive models are available
 for all manner of complex fluids, including entangled linear polymers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and even more exotic materials like entangled telechelic star polymers

\end_inset

.
 In principal, these models are useful for directly modeling industrially
 relevant fluids under industrially relevant flow conditions, but in practice
 this is not always true - many industrially relevant complex fluids (e.g.
 drilling muds, fracking fluids, emulsions, etc.) are processed at high Reynolds
 numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical bench-scale rheology experiments are not always adequate for predicing
 a material's rheology at high Reynolds numbers.
 For example, when processing a dense suspension, the particle loading is
 chosen to be as high as possible without jamming under the desired flow
 conditions.
 However, the critical shear rate for jamming under steady shear flow conditions
 (as might be measured in a laboratory setting) can not be used to predict
 the critical flow rate for jamming under turbulent flow conditions.
 In a turbulent flow, the chaotic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fluctuations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will lead to regions of flow becoming locally jammed, which can then percolate
 a jamming transition across the whole system!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a sense, a turbulent flow imparts an additional level of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microstructure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the fluid at length-scales and time-scales much smaller and much faster
 than those of the overall process.
 This separation of scales makes direct numerical simulation impractical
 - ideally, one would prefer to treat the turbulence itself as an additional
 level of micostructure to be averaged out.

The notion of turbulence as an additional level of microstructure (c.f.
 Figure

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-28-1,key-30,key-31"

\end_inset

, but at this point Reynolds-averaged constitutive models for complex fluids
 are mostly limited to simple approximations of simple fluids, like the
 FENE-P model for dilute polymer solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-32"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The process of constructing Reynolds averaged constitutive equations is
 difficult in practice but straightforward in principal; just as particle-scale
 constitutive equations rely on closure approximations informed by particle-base
d simulations, Reynolds-averaged constitutive equations rely on closure
 approximations informed by direct numerical simulation of the particle-scale
 constitutive equation in simple turbulent flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a starting point on this project, I would like to develop Reynolds-averaged
 constitutive equations for dense suspensions, leaning recent models I helped
 develop during my postdoc 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-54,key-55"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to describe microstructure evolution at the particle-scale.
 These dense suspension models are, in my view, the first to contain sufficient
 microscopic detail to be useful for turbulent flow modeling: they have
 been successfully validated in reversing flows, shear-jamming flows, and
 flows with unsteady perturbations

 Immediate applications for a Reynolds-averaged extension could include
 modeling of drilling muds, industrial concrete mixers, mudslides, and more.

The gypsy moth (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) is an invasive species that can
 cause enormous damage to ecosystems through defoliation of hardwood trees

 The moth was originally native to Europe, but was introduce to Massachusetts
 around 1870, whereafter it began to spread westwards 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-32-1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the early days, it was difficult to contain the spread of the gypsy
 moth population - there were few natural predators, and species-specific
 pathogens (e.g.
 Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus or LdMNPV) are
 not a strong control method unless the moth population is already moderately
 high 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 In this respect, viral controls were (and still are) helpful in the short
 term but not viable as a long-term control measure.
\begin_inset Branch hidden

\begin_layout Standard
The transmission mechanism of LdMNPV is very interesting and poorly suited
 to standard 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compartment models
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of disease transmission (like the SIR model).
 After infecting a host caterpillar, the virus causes the caterpillar to
 climb to the top of a tree, whereafter the host's body will eventually
 disintegrate and the virus will be dispersed through the surrounding foliage.
 If another caterpillar consumes the contaminated foliage, it will suffer
 the same fate and the cycle will continue.
 When the caterpillars are present in high densities, this is a highly efficient
 transmission mechanism.
 At lower densities, however, the virus does not persist long enough (or
 disperse far enough) to be effective.
 The well-defined time-delays between infection and transmission mean that
 LdMNPV is best described by itime since infection' models, which are now
 in the pyross library...
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Pathogens that are not species specific, like baculoviridae, can also be
 useful for short-term control of major outbreaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, the gypsy moth population continues to spread but it now poses a
 greatly reduced long-term risk to natural habitats, primarily due to a
 species-specific fungus from Japan (Entomophaga maimaiga) that was first
 established in New York in the late 1980s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-34"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unlike the viral pathogen LdMNPV, the fungal spores can persist in the
 environment for years, making it effective for long-term population control
 even when the moth population is low.
 At the leading edge of the gypsy moth invasion, however, this fungus is
 not yet established in the environment and there is still an abundance
 of foliage and an absence of natural predators.
 In the very long term, both the gypsy moth and its fungal pathogen will
 inevitably establish themselves across North America, and the fungal pathogen
 will keep population levels in check.
 But to reach this final state, what control measures best balance the total
 damage to our ecosystems against the total cost of containment? The question
 of optimal control is still an ongoing area of research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To that end, I would like to use sophisticated new epidemic modeling tools
 (like those in the pyRoss library I worked on for COVID-19 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-19,key-20,key-21"

\end_inset

) to study optimal control measures in systems involving invasive species
 and two complementary control pathogens: one with a long persistence time
 but a low reproduction rate (e.g.
 the fungus) and another with a high reproduction rate but a low persistence
 time (e.g.
 the virus).
 The gypsy moth and its pathogens are an appealing system for a first applicatio
n, but I believe that the general modeling framework may prove interesting
 for other invasive species, where long-term biological control measures
 are still a subject of active research (e.g.
 cane toads, emerald ash borers, etc).

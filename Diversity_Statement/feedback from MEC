Hi Joe

I am not sure you need the opening paragraph; I think the overall effect would be more balanced 
without it -- starting with your own story and then turning to inclusivity proper.

If you do keep the first para, either make it gender neutral from the opening sentence onward or,
if the use of the word 'man' was intentionally non-neutral, the reason for doing that needs to be
clear by the end of that para.

The second paragraph sounds very slightly patronizing to people of a background similar to yours
who, for whatever reason, did not 'escape' the MidWest. I know this is unintentional, but stuff 
about 'the cultural pinnacle of humanity' sounds a bit sarcastic and condescending (at least to
my British ears!).

The origami stuff is definitely worth including, but the end of that paragraph makes it almost
sound like having an origami club in every school will solve the problem entirely. Also, there's
a claim that geometric / spatial reasoning is itself gendered -- obviously good to get girls
involved but not if they feel left behind on that. So, you may want to add a sentence or two just
pointing towards other ideas. Something relevant, and not that far from origami, is

PS -- to articulate further my unease about para 2:

You may well end up with a faculty job in the midwest, mentoring students (with local caring
responsibilities, say) for whom grad school in Santa Barbara and postdoc in Cambridge is not 
on the agenda. Somehow you have to to bring the world to them, rather than just launch them out
into it. The fact that you've travelled will help you do that but you have to say how.
